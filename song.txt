Cause your sky,
Your sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, oo-oo, oo-oo

I love the way you walk into the room
Body shining lightin' up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what you sayin'
The way that you protect your friends
Baby I respect you for that

And when you grow you'll take everyone you love along
I love that shit
Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul, you're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know
